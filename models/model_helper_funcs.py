Brief Description of Each Model
======================================================================


XGB (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
    Start with randomized weights.
    Take an instance one at a time.
    "Run" it through the weights.
    Compute loss.
    Update weights by going down the gradient.

Logistic (Binary)
    Eastimate the probability that an instance is in a class
    with the logistic function (curvy one with min=0, max=1).
    Compute loss, and go down gradient descent.

Softmax Regression
    Not really a regression.
    Compute score for each possible class.
    Estimate probability for each class.
    Pick class with highest score.
    Gradient descent down loss function.

Linear SVM (Support Vector Machine) Classifier
    draw a line that seperates classes as much as possible
    Make the street as thick as possible with as little infringement

Decision Trees
    Start at root node.
    Split tree based on certain condition.
    Run down the tree to see prediction.


======================================================================
Brief Description of Metrics
======================================================================


Precision
    ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample that is negative

Recall
    ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples

F1-Score
    weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall

Support
    number of samples of the true response that lie in that class

Micro Average
    average the total true positives, false negatives and false positives

Macro Average
    average the unweighted mean per label

Weighted Average
    average the support-weighted mean per label
